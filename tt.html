            <h2 id="content1">TENNIS</h2>

            <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). 
                Each player hits a hollow rubber ball wrapped in felt over or over a net and into the opponent's court with a tennis 
                racquet connected with cord. The goal of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is unable 
                to return it. The player who is unable to return the ball in a legitimate manner does not receive a point, 
                however the opposing player does.</p>

            <p>A game is made up of a series of points played by the same player. The first player to win at least 
                four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent wins the game. Each game's 
                running score is described in a tennis-specific fashion, with scores ranging from zero to three points 
                being referred to as "love," "15," "30," and "40," respectively. If each player has scored at least three 
                points and their scores are identical at 40, the score is called "deuce" rather than "40–40."If each side has 
                scored at least three points and one player has one point more than his opponent, the game score is "advantage" 
                for the player in the lead.</p>

            <p>On opposite sides of the net, the players or teams begin. The server is one player, while the receiver is the opposite player.
                Before the warm-up begins, a coin toss determines whether the first game will be played as a server or receiver, 
                as well as which ends will be used. Game each game, service is switched between the two players or teams. 
                The server begins each point behind the baseline, between the center mark and the sideline. 
                The recipient can begin from any point on their side of the network. 
                The server will serve when the receiver is ready, but the receiver must play at the server's pace.</p>

            <h2 id="content2">BADMINTON</h2>

            <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. 
                Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) 
                and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; 
                formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet 
                and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.</p>

            <p>The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, 
                although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only.
                The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of the same length. 
                The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, 
                is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.</p>

            <p>When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault. 
                The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines,
                 until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, 
                so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.</p>

            <h2  id="content3">SQUASH</h2>

            <p>Squash is a racket and ball sport played by two players in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. 
                The players alternate in striking the ball with their rackets onto the playable surfaces of the four walls of the court. 
                The objective of the game is to hit the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. 
                There are about 20 million people who play squash regularly world-wide in over 185 countries.</p>

            <p>The squash court is a playing surface surrounded by four walls. The court surface contains a front line separating the front and back of the court 
                and a half court line, separating the left and right sides of the back portion of the court, creating three 'boxes': the front half, 
                the back left quarter and the back right quarter. Both the back two boxes contain smaller service boxes.The court's four walls are divided into a front wall, two side walls, 
                and a back wall. An 'out line' runs along the top of the front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall.</p>

            <p>After the serve, the players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. 
                The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, as long as it hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting 
                the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line along the top of the tin is considered to be out. 
                After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) 
                before a player must return it.</p>

            <p>Games are played according to point-a-rally scoring (PARS) to 11 points. PARS is almost universally preferred by the game's top professionals, 
                and is the current official scoring system for all levels of professional squash tournaments. In PARS, the winner of a rally receives a point, 
                regardless of whether they were the server or returner. Games are played to 11 and must be won by two points. That is, if the score reaches 10–10, 
                play continues until one player wins by two points. Competition matches are usually played to "best-of-five" games (i.e. the first player to win three games).</p>

            <h2  id="content4">TABLE TENNIS</h2>
            <P>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, 
                also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small solid rackets. 
                The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: 
                players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce once on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces 
                on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. 
                Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, 
                giving the hitter a great advantage.</P>

            <p>In game play, the player serving the ball commences a play. The server first stands with the ball held on the open palm of the hand not carrying the paddle,
                called the freehand, and tosses the ball directly upward without spin, at least 16 cm (6.3 in) high.
                The server strikes the ball with the racket on the ball's descent so that it touches first his court and then touches 
                directly the receiver's court without touching the net assembly. In casual games, many players do not toss the ball upward; 
                however, this is technically illegal and can give the serving player an unfair advantage.</p>
           
            <p>The ability of one player to overcome another through well-thought-out strategy piques the interest of the audience. 
                Increasing the game's speed, slowing it down, changing the direction of the ball or imparting new spin or tempo to it, and using 
                soft drop shots over the net when the opponent is out of position are all strategies that might be utilized to assist the intended strategy.
                Slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that, at the 1936 world championships in Prague, an hour was needed to decide a single point. 
                Play is now restricted. If a game is unfinished 15 minutes after it has begun, the rest of that game and the remaining games of the match proceed 
                under the Expedite System. Thereafter, if the service and 13 following strokes of the server are returned by the receiver, the server loses the point. 
                The service changes after each point.</p>
            
            <p>The stance is also known as the'ready position' in table tennis. It is the position that every player assumes after 
                receiving the ball and returns to after playing a shot in order to be ready for the following stroke. It entails placing the 
                feet wider than shoulder width apart and assuming a partial crouch; the crouch is a quick-moving posture that also preloads the muscles, 
                allowing for greater dynamic movement. The player's upper body is somewhat forward, and he is staring forward. With a bent arm, 
                the racket is held at the ready. The posture should feel balanced, with a firm foundation for striking and rapid lateral movement.Players may customize their posture based on their personal preferences, 
                and change it during the game depending on the situation.</p>
